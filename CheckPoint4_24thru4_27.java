		4.24
		If 'x' is an int variable and 'rand' is a reference to a Random
		object then the statement 

		x = rand.nextInt();

		assigns an int value between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,648
		to 'x'.

		4.25
		Same as 4.24, what does the following statement do?

		x = rand.nextInt(100);

		It assigns an int value between 0 - 99 to 'x'.

		4.26
		Same as 4.24, what does the following statement do?

		x = rand.nextInt(9) + 1;

		It assigns an int value between 1 - 9 to 'x'.

		4.27
		Assume 'x' is a double variable, and rand references a Random object.
		What does the following statement do?

		x = rand.nextDouble();

		It assigns a double value between 0.0 - 1.0 to 'x'.

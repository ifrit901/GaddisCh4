		/*
		1. What will the following code display?

		int x = 5;
		System.out.println(x++);

		answer a.
		It will print "5". The increment operator ++ is in postfix mode
		so 'x' doesn't become 6 until after the statement is completed.

		2. What will the following code display?

		int x = 5;
		System.out.println(++x);

		answer b.
		The increment operator is in prefix mode so 'x' will become 6
		before the println statement is completed.

		3. In the expression number++, the ++ operator is in what mode?

		answer c. Postfix mode.

		4. answer d. Each cycle of a loop is called an iteration.

		5. What is a variable that controls the number of iterations
		performed by a loop?

		answer a. A loop control variable.

		6. A while loop is what type of loop?

		answer a. A while loop is a pre-test loop because it tests a 
		condition before executing. If the test is true then the program
		enters the loop and remains until the condition becomes false.

		7. What type of loop is a do-while loop?

		answer b. A do-while loop always executes once, then afterwards
		a condition is tested to see if the loop will continue.(posttest)

		8. What type of loop is a for loop?

		answer a. The for loop is a pretest loop because it evaluates
		the test expression before each iteration, even the first iteration.

		9. This type of loop has no way of ending and repeats until the 
		program is interrupted.

		answer c. Infinite loop. 

		10. This type of loop always executes once.

		answer b. do-while loop.

		11. This expression is executed by the for loop only once, 
		regardless of the number of iterations.

		answer a. The initialization expression assigns a value to a variable,
		typically a loop-counter variable, and this happens even if the 
		test expression is false to begin with causing there to be zero
		iterations of the loop. 

		12. This is a variable that keeps a running total.

		answer d. Accumulator variable.

		13. This is a special value that signals when there are no more
		items from a list of items to be processed. This value cannot
		be mistaken for an item from the list.

		answer a. Sentinel value.(variable)

		14. To open a file for writing, you use the following class. 

		answer a. PrintWriter class.

		15. To open a file for reading, you use the following classes.

		answer d. File and Scanner. 

		16. When a program is finished using a file, it should do this.

		answer b. Close the file.

		17. This class allows you to use the print and println methods
		to write data to a file.

		answer d. The PrintWriter class.
		
		18. This class allows you to read a line from a file.

		answer b. The Scanner class.

		True/False
		19. The while loop is a pre-test loop. T
		20. The do-while loop is a pre-test loop. F
		21. The for loop is a post-test loop. F
		22. It is not necessary to initialize accumulator variables. F
		23. One limitation of the for loop is that only one variable may 
		be initialized in the initialization expression.F
		24. A variable may be defined in the initialization expression 
		of a for loop. T
		25. In a nested loop, the inner loop goes through all of its 
		iterations for every iteration of the outer loop. T
		26. To calculate the total number of iterations of a nested loop, 
		add the number of iterations of all the loops. F
